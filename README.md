Ionic iOS animation flickering
=====================

This is very simple project with one button revealing panel (sliding in from the bottom). Works fine on Androids and desktops but flickers on iOS (both emulator and real device). 

I'm not using any other external libs, just Ionic built-in animations.

It's quite hard to show it on video but check the [bug demonstration video](http://screencast.com/t/Ydw3lnX8o). There is only one flicker recorded but in reality there is much more than that. Please check out this project and try to emulate on iOS.


If you happen to know what it is and how to fix that, I'd be glad to read about it.
